### Agents that **plan, don't react.**

The model writes a typed plan **once**. The runtime runs it. Tool outputs never go
back through the model — so your agent **can't be prompt-injected through its tools,
costs a fraction, and runs the same every time.**

## Quickstart

```ts
import { Agent, createTool } from "oyadotai";
import { anthropic } from "oyadotai/anthropic";
import { z } from "zod";

const getWeather = createTool({
  id: "get_weather",
  description: "Look up the weather for a city",
  inputSchema: z.object({ city: z.string() }),
  execute: async ({ city }) => fetchWeather(city),
});

const agent = new Agent({
  model: anthropic("claude-haiku-4-5-20251001"),
  tools: { get_weather: getWeather },
});

const { text } = await agent.generate("How's the weather in NYC?");
```

That's the whole API — the **same shape as Mastra**. Types are inferred from your
zod schema, and every value is `OPAQUE` to the model by default. You did less work
and it's injection-safe.

## The numbers

Same task, same tools, real Anthropic API, 3 trials on `claude-opus-4-7`:

| | Vercel AI SDK | Mastra | **oya** |
|---|--:|--:|--:|
| total tokens | 3,653 | 9,143 | **1,783** |
| model round-trips | 4 | 4 | **2** |
| latency | 20.0s | 20.2s | **6.3s** |
| same plan every run? | no | no | **yes** |

**½ the tokens of the leanest loop, 5× fewer than Mastra, ~3× faster — and
deterministic.** Reproduce: `bun run bench claude-opus-4-7`. (The gap narrows on
smaller/cheaper models and widens with bigger payloads — full methodology and
numbers in [`benchmarks/`](https://github.com/OyaAIProd/oya/tree/main/benchmarks).)

## Why

Every other agent framework is a **token loop** (ReAct, LangGraph, AutoGen, Mastra,
the Vercel AI SDK): the model picks a tool, sees the **raw** result, picks the next.
Every URL, ID, and document flows back through the model. Three bugs follow — every
time:

```
fetched:    https://example.io/q3-report.pdf
downloaded: https://example.com/q3-report.pdf     ← the model "fixed" the URL
```
```
expected:  fetch → validate → download
observed:  fetch → download → validate (skipped)  ← the model reordered the steps
```
```
$432 in tokens   ← re-reading every result through the model
 $51 in tokens   ← reading only what it needs to decide
```

Same root cause: **the model read state it never needed to.** oya makes that
impossible. The model emits a typed dataflow plan; the runtime executes the DAG;
each value is shown to the model only at the level the plan declares:

| level | the model sees | for |
|---|---|---|
| `OPAQUE` *(default)* | type + provenance — **never the bytes** | URLs, IDs, docs, payloads, secrets |
| `SUMMARY` | a bounded projection (`{count}`) | facts to branch on |
| `TRANSPARENT` | the full value | the user's message, the final answer |

An attacker can stuff a payload into any fetched page. The model **never reads that
handle**, so indirect prompt injection through tool output has nowhere to land. You
annotate none of this — it's `OPAQUE` by default.

## Migrate from Mastra in 2 lines

`createTool` and `Agent` mirror `@mastra/core`. Change the imports; the code stays:

```diff
- import { Agent } from "@mastra/core/agent";
- import { createTool } from "@mastra/core/tools";
- import { anthropic } from "@ai-sdk/anthropic";
+ import { Agent, createTool } from "oyadotai";
+ import { anthropic } from "oyadotai/anthropic";
```

Same `createTool({ id, inputSchema, execute })` and
`new Agent({ name, instructions, model, tools }).generate(prompt)` (returns
`{ text }`). The difference is underneath: oya emits a checked plan and executes it
instead of looping — so a migrated app gets the numbers above for free.

## Studio

Chat with your agents and watch each plan execute live — the DAG, the trace, and
every value at its projection level (`OPAQUE` shows nothing, `TRANSPARENT` shows
the value). In your project:

```ts
// oya.config.ts
export default { agents: { support } };
```
```bash
bunx oyadotai dev      # → oya Studio at localhost:4000
```

## Use it anywhere

oya is a **library, not a platform**. Run an agent in a script, a Next.js route, a
Bun server, a worker, the edge — `await agent.generate(prompt)`. Stream it with
`agent.stream(prompt)` (structured events, not a token soup) and render it with
`oya/react`'s `usePlan` / `useChat`, or serve SSE with `oyadotai-server`.

## Built on this: [oya.ai](https://oya.ai)

This package is the **open-source core** that [**oya.ai**](https://oya.ai) runs on —
the same plan-once runtime, projection types, and Studio, now hosted. Want the
managed platform (deploy agents, schedules, skills, and the Studio without running
any infrastructure) instead of wiring it up yourself? Start at
**[oya.ai](https://oya.ai)** — everything you build against this library is the same
engine that powers it.

## Install

```bash
bun add oyadotai zod
```

## Packages

| package | what |
|---|---|
| `oyadotai` | the runtime + `Agent` + `createTool`; `oyadotai/anthropic` · `oyadotai/openai` · `oyadotai/google` providers; `oyadotai/react` hooks; the `oya dev` studio |
| `oyadotai-server` | `toSSEResponse` / `toTextResponse` for any Fetch server |
| `@oya/playground` | the Next.js studio (`make dev`) |
| `@oya/benchmarks` | the live comparison above |

## Develop

```bash
make dev        # oya Studio
make test       # bun:test — checked against the Python reference runtime
make bench      # the comparison
make check      # typecheck + test, every package
```
